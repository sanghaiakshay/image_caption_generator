Although many other image captioning datasets (Flickr30k, COCO) are available, Flickr8k is chosen because it takes only a few hours of training on GPU to produce a good model. The dataset contains 8000 of images each of which has 5 captions by different people. Having more than one caption for each image is desirable because an image can be described in many ways.\n","\n","This is how the flow of tutorial looks:\n","1. Download Flickr dataset\n","2.

Create tokenizer to process captions\n","Why do we need a tokenizer? We can't feed words directly in a LSTM. We have to feed the words represented by numbers. Tokenizer is available from keras preprocessing and we will use it for this task. One thing I would like to point out is when tokenizer fits on the texts, it removes punctuation and then creates the mapping from word to numbers. We have defined vocab_size (we will use later) as number of words in tokenizer plus 1 to accomodate for 0. The safe option is to use a vocab_size little bigger than number of words in training data to accomodate for unseen words.\n","\n","*L3*: train_encoded_captions is the tokenized version of train_captions. All the words of captions have been converted to numbers. We will use this list later in batch_generator."]},{"metadata":{"id":"bYb32kUHb9x_","colab_type":"code","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":154},"outputId":"de61ce21-c198-4807-a2c7-072ad1f65bef","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1534442492936,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":2770,"user":{"displayName":"Akshay
